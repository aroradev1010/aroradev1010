Hi there 👋  
This is where I build things, break things, and learn by shipping real code.

🔭 I’m currently working on production-grade full-stack systems    
💬 Ask me about Next.js, React, Node.js, APIs, authentication, and scalable app design  
👨‍💻 Most of my work lives here on GitHub  
⚡ I enjoy understanding *why* systems are built the way they are, not just *how*

## ✨ About Me

I am a B.Tech Computer Science student (2023–2027) with strong hands-on experience in full-stack web development.

I have built and maintained **production-grade applications** using Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and MongoDB, focusing on clean architecture, scalability, and maintainability. I am comfortable working with complex codebases, backend APIs, authentication systems, real-time data flow, and modular design.

I am actively transitioning into **open-source development** to improve code quality, collaboration skills, and real-world engineering practices.

## 🧠 What I Like Working On

- Full-stack applications with real users  
- Backend APIs and data flow  
- Authentication, authorization, and role-based systems  
- Clean, modular codebases  
- Understanding existing systems before extending them
